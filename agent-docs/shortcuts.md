# Keyboard shortcuts

The chord system shared by mail, calendar and drive, the app-wide keys, and the keys inside the search dialog. Paths are relative to `apps/web/`. See also [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md), [ui.md](ui.md), [search.md](search.md), [drive.md](drive.md).

## Rules

- **`useChord` is the only chord primitive.**
- **Each surface has one chord, and its prefix is the surface's letter** (`m` mail, `c` calendar, `d` drive).
- **The only bare keys are `j` / `n` and `k` / `p`.** They are next / previous on mail and calendar, forward / back on drive; everything else is prefix + key.
- **The chord listener runs in the capture phase and `stopImmediatePropagation`s what it consumes**, because the bare keys live in a separate bubble-phase listener. That ordering stops the `n` of drive's `d n` (new folder) from also reaching bare `n` (forward).
- **An armed prefix followed by an unbound key is swallowed**, so a typo after the prefix fires nothing.
- **The same `bindings` object feeds the handler, `ChordHint` and `ShortcutsHelp`**, so hint, help and handler cannot drift; the bare keys reach the help from each surface's `*_UNCHORDED` list.
- **Shortcuts are skipped while typing** (`isTypingTarget`).

## How it works

- **`useChord({ prefix, bindings })`** arms on the prefix for `CHORD_WINDOW_MS`, runs `bindings[key]` on the next key, and toggles help on `?`.
- **Drive's bare keys walk a visited-path stack.** `DriveNavigationProvider` records every pathname change under the drive tree; it is provided from `d/layout.tsx`, above `[drive]`, so it survives switching drives.
- **`Alt/Option + 1…9` switches to the nth workspace app-wide**, matched on `e.code` (`Digit1`…`Digit9`) so it works on any keyboard layout.
- **`Ctrl/⌘ + K` opens workspace search app-wide** except while typing in a field, so an editor keeps its own shortcut.
- **Inside the search dialog:**
  - ↑/↓ move between results;
  - Enter runs a result's first action;
  - Tab or → (or the ⋯ button) opens its action list, and Tab first accepts a suggestion;
  - Mod+Enter opens the actions too;
  - Esc goes back from an action list, or closes the dialog.

## Deliberate limits

- **Chords are per surface.** The only app-wide keys are the workspace switch and search.
